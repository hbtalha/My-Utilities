I downloaded a youtube playlist with tutorial videos. 
But in that playlist the videos weren't sorted by the order of classes I had no way of sort the tutorial videos correctly.
I briefly googled softwares that would do me the job but found none that did exactly what I wanted/ So I created this program.
To be noted, that it still was very tedious to number the tutorials correctly with this program.
